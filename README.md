##StudentDetails.PHP
This folder contains the coding for a client-server application designed to register student details using an HTML form. The form includes fields for the student's name, matric number, current address, home address, email address, phone number, and emergency home number. Each input field is designed to ensure the security and integrity of the data being submitted, with measures in place to prevent data breaches and SQL injection attacks.

To ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data being submitted, each input field has its own specific requirements that the user must adhere to. For example, the email address field requires a valid email address format, while the phone number field may require a specific format, 10 digit numbers only. By enforcing these requirements, the application is able to collect high-quality data that can be used for a variety of purposes, such as student record-keeping.

##Style.css
This folder contains CSS scripts that have been specifically designed for the Studentdetails.php page. The goal of these scripts is to create a design that is in line with the requirements provided by Dr. The CSS scripts aim to replicate the design that has been provided, ensuring that all of the elements on the page are properly aligned, appropriately sized, and visually appealing by following these design requirements.

##Process.PHP
This folder contains PHP code that has been designed for server-side scripting purposes. The PHP code has been developed with an aim to strengthen the security measures by including additional sanitizing and filtering functionalities. The code also includes several regular expression (regex) patterns to ensure that the data entered by users meets the required input format. These additional security measures and filtering functionalities are crucial to prevent potential security breaches and data manipulation by malicious actors. The PHP code may also include error handling mechanisms to ensure that any errors or issues that may arise during the data submission process are dealt with appropriately. In addition to the security and filtering functionalities, the PHP code in this folder includes HTML code that is responsible for displaying the information input by the user. This HTML code is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, making it easy for users to review the information they have entered.

##Stylesubmit.css
The stylesubmit.css file in this folder has been created to design the HTML elements present in the process.php file. The purpose of this CSS file is to ensure that the HTML elements in the process.php file are visually appealing, user-friendly, and consistent with the design of the overall application. The stylesubmit.css file may include various design elements such as font types, font sizes, color schemes, background images, and spacing between elements. These design elements are carefully chosen to ensure that the overall design is cohesive and visually appealing.
